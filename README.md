The Snake Game is a classic arcade game built using JavaScript. It features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The goal is to avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

The game includes various functionalities and features to enhance the gaming experience. It is designed to adapt to all media devices, making it playable on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The game interface consists of a game board, which is a grid-based canvas where the snake and food are displayed. The snake starts with a length of one block and moves continuously in a particular direction. The player controls the snake's movement using buttons on the screen, such as up, down, left, and right.

As the snake eats food, it grows longer by adding additional blocks to its body. The score is displayed on the screen and increases every time the snake consumes food. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body. At that point, the player's final score is shown, and they can choose to restart the game.

The game is designed with responsive web design principles, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. This ensures an optimal gaming experience regardless of the device being used.

Overall, the Snake Game built using JavaScript provides a fun and interactive gaming experience. It incorporates game controls through buttons, displays the score, and ensures compatibility with various media devices.
